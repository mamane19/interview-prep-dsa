# You’re in charge of the fireworks display, and you have a list of fireworks to shoot off.
# You want to make sure you don’t fire the same colors twice in a row. Given an array of fireworks,
# return a valid firing order. You decide how you want an impossible solution to work!

# Example:
# $ orderFireworks(['green','green','green','red','red','blue'])
# $ ['green','red','green','red','green','blue']

# TODO: Later
def orderFireworks(fireworks):
    pass
