# A string is said to be a k-interspace string if the absolute difference of the
# ASCII values of every pair of adjacent characters is at most k. For example - "abac" is a k-interspace
# string for k â‰¥ 2 since the absolute difference between every adjacent character of it is at most 2.
# A substring is any group of contiguous characters in a string. For example, the substrings of
# abc = [abc, ab, bc, a, b, c]. A substring of a string is said to be k-interspace substring
# if the substring is a k-interspace string.

# Given a string, word, and an integer, k, find the longest k-interspace substring within word.
# If there are multiple substrings of the longest length, return the one that occurs first in word.
