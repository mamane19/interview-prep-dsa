# This question is asked by Apple. 
# You are tasked with painting a row of houses in your neighborhood such that each house is painted 
# either red, blue, or green. The cost of painting the ith house red, blue or green, is given by costs[i][0], 
# costs[i][1], and costs[i][2] respectively. Given that you are required to paint each house and no two adjacent 
# houses may be the same color, return the minimum cost to paint all the houses.

# Ex: Given the following costs arrayâ€¦
# costs = [[1, 3, 5],[2, 4, 6],[5, 4, 3]], return 8.
# Paint the first house red, paint the second house blue, and paint the third house green.
