# This question is asked by Amazon.
# You’re running a popsicle stand where each popsicle costs $5.
# Each customer you encountered pays with either a $5 bill, a $10 bill, or a $20 bill and only buys
# a single popsicle. the customers that come to your stand come in the ordered given by the customers
# array where customers[i] represents the bill the ith customer pays with. Starting with $0,
# return whether or not you can serve all the given customers while also giving the correct amount of change.

# Ex: Given the following customers…

# customers = [5, 10], return true
# collect $5 from the first customer, pay no change.
# collet $10 from the second customer and give back $5 change.

# Ex: Given the following customers…

# customers = [10], return false
# collect $10 from the first customer and we cannot give back change.

# Ex: Given the following customers…

# customers = [5,5,5,10,20], return true
# collect $5 from the first 3 customers.
# collect $10 from the fourth customer and give back $5 change.
# collect $20 from the fifth customer and give back $10 change ($10 bill and $5 bill).
