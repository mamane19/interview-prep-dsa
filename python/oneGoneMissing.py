# This question is asked by Amazon. 
# Given an array that contains all distinct values from zero through N except one number, 
# return the number that is missing from the array.

# Ex: Given the following array numsâ€¦
# nums = [1, 4, 2, 0], return 3.
# 3 is the only number missing in the array between 0 and 4.

# Ex: Given the following array numsâ€¦
# nums = [6, 3, 1, 2, 0, 5], return 4.
# 4 is the only number missing in the array between 0 and 6.


def find_missing_number(nums):
     nums.sort()
     for i in range(len(nums)):
          if nums[i] != i:
               return i
     return len(nums)


nums = [1, 4, 2, 0]
print(find_missing_number(nums))


nums = [6, 3, 1, 2, 0, 5]
print(find_missing_number(nums))
