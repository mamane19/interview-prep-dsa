# Given an integer n, your task is to reverse its digits in pairs. More formally, if n = d1d2d3d4... 
# (where di is the ith digit in the decimal representation of n), then the answer should be d2d1d4d3.... 
# If the number of digits is odd, the last digit should stay in the same position.

# Example

# For n = 123456, the output should be reverseDigitsInPairs(n) = 214365;

# For n = 72328, the output should be reverseDigitsInPairs(n) = 27238.

# Since n has an odd number of digits, the last digit 8 is not swapped with any other digit.

# Input/Output

# [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

# [input] integer n

# A 32-bit integer. It is guaranteed that

# The second digit of n is not zero.
# The number after reversing digits in pairs also fits in a 32-bit integer type.
# Guaranteed constraints:
# 1 â‰¤ n < 109.

# [output] integer

# An integer, obtained by reversing the digits of n in pairs
