// # Given an array of non-negative integers that represent the bars (y value) in a
// # histogram (with the array index being the x value), find the rectangle with the largest
// # area under the curve and above the x-axis (i.e. the largest rectangle that fits inside the
// # histogram). Return the pair of array indices that represent the rectangle.
// # * Test Cases
// # Note that there may be other valid answers.
// # For array [2,4,2,1], the largest area is 6, with height 2, and width from indices 0 to 2:
// # For array [2,4,2,1,10,6,10] the largest area is 18, with height 6 and width from
// # indices 4 to 6.
